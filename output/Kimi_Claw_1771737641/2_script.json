Kimi Claw is a cloud-based deployment service from Kimi that lets you launch the OpenClaw automation platform in literally seconds. No VPS required, no hardware to manage, no server maintenance. You get 24/7 uptime guaranteed, which means your automation runs around the clock without you lifting a finger. Each deployment comes with 40 gigabytes of storage, which is pretty generous for most automation workflows. And here's the kicker - you get instant access to over 5,000 skills from the ClawHub marketplace. That's thousands of pre-built automation tools ready to go.\", visual_markers=[VisualMarker(marker_type='screenshot', url='https://www.kimi.com/resources/kimi-claw-introduction', description=None, section_id='main', focus_text='24/7 Uptime'), VisualMarker(marker_type='visual', url=None, description='Cloud icon with gear animation - showing automation flow', section_id='main', focus_text=None)], estimated_duration_seconds=38.0, start_time=34.8)",
