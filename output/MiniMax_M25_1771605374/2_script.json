Every single month, there's a new AI model that claims to be the next big thing. Most of them are just incremental updates dressed up with marketing buzzwords. But MiniMax M2.5? This is different. This model just dropped some numbers that should make every developer, every engineering manager, and honestly every tech company paying attention. We're talking 80.2% on SWE-Bench Verified - that's essentially a pass on almost 9 out of 10 real-world software engineering problems. And it's priced at just thirty cents per hour. Thirty cents! That's less than what most of us spend on a bad cup of coffee. So today, we're breaking down exactly why MiniMax M2.5 might be the most important AI release of the year, and why you should actually care about what's happening in the AI space right now.\", visual_markers=[VisualMarker(marker_type='screenshot', url='https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m25', description=None, section_id='intro')], estimated_duration_seconds=55.6, start_time=0.0)",

MiniMax M2.5 is the latest release from MiniMax, and they've made something pretty bold here. They've positioned this as what they're calling the first frontier model focused on cost accessibility. Now, what does that mean in plain English? It means they've built a model that competes with the big dogs like Claude and GPT-4 in terms of capability, but at a fraction of the cost. And here's the wild part - it's not some stripped-down version or a lighter model that's been nerfed. This is full-blown state-of-the-art performance. The model was trained using reinforcement learning across hundreds of thousands of complex real-world environments. That's not just textbook training - this is learning from actual, messy, real-world scenarios. We're talking about problems that actual developers face every single day, not just synthetic benchmarks. And the results speak for themselves.\", visual_markers=[VisualMarker(marker_type='visual', url=None, description='Split screen showing coding interface on left, benchmark scores on right', section_id='main_overview')], estimated_duration_seconds=58.400000000000006, start_time=55.6)",
    "ScriptSection(section_id='main_benchmarks', section_type='main', title=\"The Numbers Don't Lie\", narration_text=\"Let's talk benchmarks, because these are the metrics that actually matter. SWE-Bench Verified - 80.2%. For those who aren't familiar, SWE-Bench tests AI models on real-world GitHub issues. We're talking actual bugs, actual feature requests, actual problems that developers submit. 80.2% means this model can solve nearly 9 out of 10 real software engineering problems. That's insane. But it gets better. Multi-SWE-Bench - 51.3%. This is the multi-language version, and it shows this model isn't just good at English coding tasks. It handles multilingual coding environments with serious competence. And BrowseComp - 76.3% with context management. This measures how well the model can browse, search, and gather information while keeping track of context. These aren't cherry-picked numbers either. These are independent evaluations that show M2.5 is genuinely competing with the top models in the industry.\", visual_markers=[], estimated_duration_seconds=54.0, start_time=114.0)",
    "ScriptSection(section_id='deep_dive_architecture', section_type='deep_dive', title='The Secret Sauce: Architectural Thinking', narration_text=\"Now here's where it gets really interesting. There's one feature of M2.5 that doesn't get enough attention, and it's what MiniMax calls architectural thinking. You know how the best developers don't just jump into writing code? They plan. They decompose problems. They write specifications first. Well, M2.5 does the same thing. Before it writes a single line of code, it demonstrates spec-writing tendencies. It breaks down features into components, plans the architecture, and then implements. This is a fundamental shift in how these models operate. Most AI coding assistants are essentially autocomplete on steroids - they generate code as they go. M2.5 actually thinks before it codes.. It plans It considers the architecture. This is why we're seeing such high scores on complex problems - because it's not just pattern matching its way to a solution, it's actually reasoning about the problem first. This approach fundamentally changes the quality of the output.\", visual_markers=[VisualMarker(marker_type='visual', url=None, description=\"Flowchart showing 'Problem \u2192 Decomposition \u2192 Planning \u2192 Implementation'\", section_id='deep_dive_architecture')], estimated_duration_seconds=60.800000000000004, start_time=168.0)",
    "ScriptSection(section_id='demo_coding', section_type='demo', title='Seeing It In Action', narration_text=\"So what does this look like in practice? Let me walk you through what happens when you give M2.5 a complex coding task. You give it a problem - let's say a multi-file refactoring task or a bug that spans multiple components. Instead of immediately spitting out code, it first analyzes the problem, identifies the key components, creates a plan, writes out the specification, and then implements. It's literally showing you its work. The agentic tool use is also incredible. It can navigate complex development environments, use command-line tools, interact with version control, and handle multi-step workflows. We're not talking about a model that can only do one thing at a time. This is a model that can handle entire development workflows from start to finish. And the multilingual performance is particularly noteworthy - it's not just trained on English-language repositories. It performs consistently across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and European languages.

Speed. M2.5 completes SWE-Bench Verified evaluations 37% faster than its predecessor, M2.1. And wait for it - it matches the speed of Claude Opus 4.6. Let me say that again. A model that's priced at a fraction of the cost is matching the inference speed of one of the most expensive models on the market. But here's what really matters - the cost efficiency. At 100 tokens per second, you're looking at about $1 per hour to run continuously. But here's the kicker - if you drop to 50 tokens per second, that cost drops to just $0.30 per hour. That's essentially free for many use cases. We're talking about a frontier-level model that doesn't require a massive GPU budget to use effectively. For indie developers, for startups, for anyone who's been priced out of using the best AI models - this changes everything.\", visual_markers=[VisualMarker(marker_type='visual', url=None, description='Speed comparison chart - M2.1 vs M2.5 vs Claude Opus 4.6', section_id='comparison_speed')], estimated_duration_seconds=63.6, start_time=292.40000000000003)",
