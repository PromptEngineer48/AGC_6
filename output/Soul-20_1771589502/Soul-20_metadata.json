  "description": "Soul\u20112.0 is Higgsfield\u2019s in\u2011house foundation model for fashion\u2011aware, culture\u2011native image generation. Built with creative professionals, it turns text prompts into realistic, editorial\u2011grade photos\u2014editorial spreads, campaign imagery, runway\u2011ready looks, and niche aesthetics. Soul\u20112.0 is powered by three core systems working together: SOUL for core generation, SOUL Reference for guided variations, and SOUL ID for consistent characters. SOUL Reference analyzes composition, lighting, styling cues, pose, and mood from a single reference image, then generates on\u2011brand variations that keep creative intent intact. SOUL ID adds a personalization layer for character consistency, enabling recurring visual identities, digital personas, and campaign characters. For best results, upload references from the same time period to preserve stylistic coherence. Soul\u20112.0 is designed around visual intelligence and taste, understanding fashion references, subcultural cues, and editorial framing. Whether you\u2019re building moodboards, prototyping campaign visuals, or maintaining a character across posts, Soul\u20112.0 helps you move from prompt to polished image with fewer iterations. In this video, we break down how the three systems interact, share practical tips for reference\u2011guided generation, and show how character consistency transforms a series into a cohesive brand story. If you\u2019re a designer, photographer, stylist, or brand team, Soul\u20112.0 streamlines creative workflows while preserving creative control. Watch to the end for a quick start guide and ideas for your next shoot. Subscribe for more AI breakthroughs and creative tooling updates.",
