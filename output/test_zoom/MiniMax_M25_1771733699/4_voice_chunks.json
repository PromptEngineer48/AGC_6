    "text": "Okay, here's something wild. MiniMax just dropped a new AI model that they're calling 'intelligence too cheap to meter.' That's a bold claim. But when you hear the price\u2014$1 per hour for continuous operation\u2014your ears should perk up. We're talking about a model that's supposedly matching Claude Opus 4.6 in speed while costing a fraction of what premium models charge. The MiniMax M2.5 just landed, and it's promising to revolutionize coding, agentic tasks, and office work. But does it actually deliver? That's what we're diving into today.",

    "text": "Let's talk numbers because this is where things get interesting. MiniMax M2.5 is crushing it onSWE-Bench Verified with an 80.2% score\u2014that's state-of-the-art territory, people. It also hit 51.3% on Multi-SWE-Bench, which is apparently the best in the industry for multilingual tasks, and 76.3% on BrowseComp for search and tool use. But here's the kicker: it's completing these benchmarks 37% faster than its predecessor M2.1, and it's matching Claude Opus 4.6's speed while being dramatically cheaper. The model was trained using reinforcement learning across hundreds of thousands of complex real-world environments, which explains these gains.",

    "text": "Now here's what really caught my attention. During training, MiniMax M2.5 developed something called a 'spec-writing tendency'\u2014it naturally decomposes and plans features before implementation, thinking like an architect rather than just churning out code. That's actually huge for developer workflows. And then there's the pricing. At $1 per hour for 100 tokens per second, or just 30 cents for the 50 TPS version, you're looking at 1/10 to 1/20 the cost of comparable models. This thing is literally designed for high-throughput, low-latency production environments. It's the first frontier model positioned as genuinely affordable for continuous operation.",

Some real-world tests are showing disappointing results compared to competitors like Kimi 2.5 and GLM 5. Users are reporting issues with hallucination and poor online search or documentation utilization in practical tests. Some benchmarks even place it below Haiku 4.5, while GLM 5 and Kimi performed above Sonnet 4.5 in certain evaluations. So while the benchmarks look incredible on paper, the real-world experience might not match up for every use case.",

    "text": "So what's the verdict? MiniMax M2.5 is genuinely impressive on benchmarks and offers unprecedented value at $1 per hour\u2014if you're doing high-volume, production-level work, this could be a game-changer. The spec-writing capability and speed improvements are real advantages. But if you're expecting Claude-level quality in every interaction, you might want to temper those expectations. It's a compelling option for teams who need serious throughput and have the expertise to work around its limitations. The future of 'intelligence too cheap to meter'? Maybe. But it's not quite the finished article yet. Hit that subscribe if you want more deep dives into the AI landscape, and let me know in the comments\u2014is this model worth the hype for your use case?",
