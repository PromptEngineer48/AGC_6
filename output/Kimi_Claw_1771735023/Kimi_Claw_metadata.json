  "description": "Meet Kimi Claw, a cloud-based deployment of OpenClaw agents that runs entirely in your browser. No installs. No API keys. No terminal commands. No server costs. Just open your browser and start automating with over 5,000 ClawHub skills.\n\nIn this demo, I show how Kimi Claw eliminates the traditional barriers to using AI agents. Because it runs in the cloud 24/7, you don\u2019t need to keep your own hardware online, and you don\u2019t have to manage servers or dependencies.
