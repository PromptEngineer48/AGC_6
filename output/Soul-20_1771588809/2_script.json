The model was co-developed with creative professionals and is native to cultural and fashion contexts. Instead of just optimizing for photorealism or prompt fidelity, SOUL 2.0 optimizes for aesthetics: composition, lighting, styling, and editorial mood. It reads subcultural cues, understands references, and produces intentionally aesthetic results. The system transforms original images into starting points for creative expansion, enabling creators to generate anything from individual artistic photos to consistent campaign characters.
