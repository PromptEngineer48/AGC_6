MiniMax M2.5 API
Production-scale agentic coding with full-stack development and office deliverables
This model isn’t available on Together’s Serverless API.
Deploy this model on an on-demand Dedicated Endpoint or pick a supported alternative from the Model Library.
MiniMax M2.5 is SOTA in coding, agentic tool use, search, and office work, extensively trained with reinforcement learning across 200,000+ complex real-world environments. The model achieves 80.2% SWE-Bench Verified while completing tasks 37% faster than M2.1, matching Claude Opus 4.6's speed. M2.5 exhibits architect-level planning capability, actively decomposing and planning features, structure, and UI design before writing code—spanning the entire development lifecycle from 0-to-1 system design through 90-to-100 comprehensive testing. Trained on 10+ programming languages across full-stack platforms (Web, Android, iOS, Windows), M2.5 delivers truly deliverable outputs in office scenarios on Together AI's production infrastructure.
