Intelligence Index Comparisons
Intelligence vs. Price
While higher intelligence models are typically more expensive, they do not all follow the same price-quality curve.

Price per token, represented as USD per million Tokens. Price is a blend of Input & Output token prices (3:1 ratio).
Figures represent performance of the model's first-party API (e.g. OpenAI for o1) or the median across providers where a first-party API is not available (e.g. Meta's Llama models).
Intelligence Index Token Use & Cost
Output Tokens Used to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index
The number of tokens required to run all evaluations in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (excluding repeats).
Cost to Run Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index
The cost to run the evaluations in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, calculated using the model's input and output token pricing and the number of tokens used across evaluations (excluding repeats).
Context Window
Context Window
Larger context windows are relevant to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) LLM workflows which typically involve reasoning and information retrieval of large amounts of data.
Maximum number of combined input & output tokens. Output tokens commonly have a significantly lower limit (varied by model).

Pricing
Pricing: Input and Output Prices
Price per token included in the request/message sent to the API, represented as USD per million Tokens.

Speed
Measured by Output Speed (tokens per second)
Output Speed
Tokens per second received while the model is generating tokens (ie. after first chunk has been received from the API for models which support streaming).

Output Speed vs. Price
Tokens per second received while the model is generating tokens (ie. after first chunk has been received from the API for models which support streaming).
Price per token, represented as USD per million Tokens. Price is a blend of Input & Output token prices (3:1 ratio).
Latency
Measured by Time (seconds) to First Token
Latency: Time To First Answer Token
Time to first answer token received, in seconds, after API request sent. For reasoning models, this includes the 'thinking' time of the model before providing an answer. For models which do not support streaming, this represents time to receive the completion.
End-to-End Response Time
Seconds to output 500 Tokens, calculated based on time to first token, 'thinking' time for reasoning models, and output speed
End-to-End Response Time
Seconds to receive a 500 token response. Key components:
- Input time: Time to receive the first response token
- Thinking time (only for reasoning models): Time reasoning models spend outputting tokens to reason prior to providing an answer. Amount of tokens based on the average reasoning tokens across a diverse set of 60 prompts (methodology details).
- Answer time: Time to generate 500 output tokens, based on output speed
Figures represent performance of the model's first-party API (e.g. OpenAI for o1) or the median across providers where a first-party API is not available (e.g. Meta's Llama models).
Model Size (Open Weights Models Only)
Model Size: Total and Active Parameters
The total number of trainable weights and biases in the model, expressed in billions. These parameters are learned during training and determine the model's ability to process and generate responses.
The number of parameters actually executed during each inference forward pass, expressed in billions. For Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, a routing mechanism selects a subset of experts per token, resulting in fewer active than total parameters. Dense models use all parameters, so active equals total.
